Rust support for the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT

See <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/> for details on the Sense HAT.

See <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-sense-hat> for the official Python driver. This one tries to follow the same API as the Python version.

See <https://github.com/thejpster/pi-workshop-rs/> for some workshop materials which use this driver.
